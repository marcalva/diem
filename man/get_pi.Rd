\title{Get mixing coefficients of Mixture model from posterior probabilities Z}
\usage{
get_pi(Z, pi_prior = 0, add = 0, add_to = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A droplet by cluster matrix of the posterior probability a 
droplet belongs to cluster k. Rows must sum to 1 and entries must 
be between 0 and 1.}

\item{pi_prior}{Add a non-informative prior by adding a count of 
\code{pi_prior} to the each cluster's membership.}

\item{add}{A number, or weight, to add to the column sums of the 
posterior probabilities. This number is added to the \code{add_to} index.}

\item{add_to}{The index to add the number \code{add} to.}
}
\value{
A cluster-length numeric vector that sums to 1 and entries 
 between 0 and 1.
