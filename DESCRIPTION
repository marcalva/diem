Description: Identification of debris-containing droplets 
        from a droplet-based single cell/nucleus RNA-seq. 'diem' uses 
        the expression profile of background RNA droplets, followed 
        by expectation maximization (EM), to assign candidates as 
        debris or nuclei. See Alvarez M, Rahmani E, et al (2019) 
        <doi:10.1101/786285> for details.
